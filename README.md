# QueueHQ

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
Most streaming services offer a queue, but we wanted to create a centralized spot for people to queue up any show or movie they want, regardless of the streaming service.

Whenever someone tells us about a show or movie that we should check out, often times our first question in response is “what streaming service is that on?” We wanted a simple way to keep track of all the content you want to get around to watching. 

As it continues to cost more and more for streaming services, the more aware we are about where we get our content from, the easier it’ll be for us to manage our subscriptions and cancel services that we rarely use.

As a viewer of shows and movies, I want a place to house all of the content that I want to stream so I don’t forget anything and so that I know what services I can find each piece of content on.

## Technologies Used
MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Performant JavaScript, GraphQL, Apollo, Mongoose ODM, NoSQL

## Deployed Application




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
